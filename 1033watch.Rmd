About Your State {.sidebar}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The [1033 program](https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Reutilization/LawEnforcement/ProgramFAQs.aspx) is an initiative that allows the Department of Defense to provide excess military equipment to state & local law enforcement agencies.

This dashboard is tracking how much each state has received under the program, and what type of equipment they received.
  
Select your state below. Search your town's police department using the search box.

```{r}
selectInput("state", "State:", choices = distinct(data1033, `State`))
```

This dashboard was created by [Gavin Rozzi](https://www.gavinrozzi.com/)

renderValueBox({
  total_shipments <- nrow(data1033 %>% filter(State == input$state))
  valueBox(total_shipments , 
           icon = "fa-truck")
})
```

### Value of equipment received

```{r}
renderValueBox({
  state_equipment <- data1033 %>% filter(State == input$state)
