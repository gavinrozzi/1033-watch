# 1033 Watch
This is a dashboard tracking 1033 program asset shipments to state & local police departments in the US.
The 1033 program is an initiative whereby the Department of Defense provides excess military hardware to local law enforcement. The military hardware is provided free of charge, but states are required to cover the cost of shipping.

Amid recent protests, the program has been criticized for encouraging the militarization of police. This dashboard was created to track shipments under the program and evaluate its impact.
